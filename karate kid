can help them see themselves as others see them.” Karate kid videos empasize the need and value of a good coach in our lives.

his work a coach tries to make his student learn in  different ways that the student sometimes feel like it is not worth, but 
trully speaking the prosperity of a building lies in the strength of its foundations
